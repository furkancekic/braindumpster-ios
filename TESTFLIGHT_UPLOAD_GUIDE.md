```
Hello App Review Team,

Thank you for your review.

SITUATION:
The three in-app purchase products (Monthly $9.99, Yearly $49.99, Lifetime $99.99)
are currently "Waiting for Review" and cannot be purchased until approved.

WHAT YOU WILL SEE:
• Complete pricing interface at: Settings → Upgrade to Premium
• Three subscription cards with pricing, descriptions, and badges
• Professional UI showing all product details
• Message: "Products are awaiting App Store approval"

This is expected. The purchase implementation is complete, but products cannot
be purchased until you approve them.

REQUEST:
Please approve the IAP products first, then re-review the app. The purchase
flow will work correctly once approved.

TO TEST:
1. Launch the app
2. Tap the gear icon (Settings) at the top right
3. Tap "Upgrade to Premium"
4. View three pricing options

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards
```
